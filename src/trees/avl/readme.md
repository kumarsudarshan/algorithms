# AVL Tree

AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree in which each node maintains extra information called a balance factor whose value is either -1, 0 or +1.

AVL tree got its name after its inventor Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Landis.

#### Balance Factor
Balance factor of a node in an AVL tree is the difference between the height of the left subtree and that of the right subtree of that node.

Balance Factor = (Height of Left Subtree - Height of Right Subtree) or (Height of Right Subtree - Height of Left Subtree)

The self balancing property of an avl tree is maintained by the balance factor. The value of balance factor should always be -1, 0 or +1.

An example of a balanced avl tree is:
